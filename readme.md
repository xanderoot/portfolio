discordBot.py was the first bot I made when i was first figuring out python and discords stuff. 
discordDefs goes with discordBot.py, it just moves some functions out of the main file for ease of reading.

gerbosDiceBot.py is a dice rolling bot that makes use of the random.org API to produce as random as feasibly possible dice rolls for my dnd groups games. 

main.py is an audio bot I use with my friends. this is the only one that wont work on its own as the yt-dl thing required a manual fix,

multithreading and multiprocessing are both tests to see how it works and how fast it is. the python 3.12 announcemnt/beta is what prompted it. I wanted to test the processing efficiency claims.
